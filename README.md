# 2D-Game
(as of now) a recreation of the Legend of Zelda NES with Java


## How to Play
- `WASD` to move
- `ENTER` to hit in the direction your currently facing
- `F` to shoot a projectile in the direction your currently facing (costs one mana, replenish after some time)
- `C` to open the Inventory, navigate with the `ARROW` keys
- `B` to switch into the bullethell state
   - `ARROW` keys to move
   - `Y` to shoot projectiles (only upwards)
   - `SHIFT` to navigate slower (reduced movement speed)

## Implemented features
- You can pick up the items laying in front of you, only the bomb and the shield work at the time
- To the left there are some test events, such as a damage trigger
- If you go in the door (black tile left above you) you'll be teleported into a chamber, where slimes reside
- Slimes can respawn if you go to the left bottom tile and press ENTER
